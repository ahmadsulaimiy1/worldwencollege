/**
 * THE STUDENTS CLUSTER — six pages.
 *
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE LINE THIS CLUSTER HAS TO HOLD
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * There are no students. Nobody has enrolled, nobody has been taught,
 * nobody has been assessed and nobody has graduated. A "Student Life"
 * page, a "Results" page, an "Alumni" page or a "Graduation" page would
 * each be a photograph of something that has not happened, and the
 * College refuses to publish those.
 *
 * What genuinely exists is everything a student would MEET: a built
 * platform, an authored curriculum, a written assessment scheme, a
 * records and verification system, and a set of academic rules — some
 * adopted, some explicitly still proposals. So this cluster is written
 * as "what you will meet and how it will treat you", in the future
 * tense where the future tense is honest, and it never narrates a
 * student experience that nobody has had.
 *
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE DISTINCTION THAT RUNS THROUGH EVERY PAGE
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Two different things both look like "the pass mark":
 *
 *   · 70% is what the PLATFORM enforces today to mark a module
 *     complete. It is live, it is in platform_config, and it governs
 *     progression right now.
 *   · The honours scheme — Pass / Merit / Distinction / High
 *     Distinction, with per-skill floors — is a PROPOSAL awaiting
 *     governance decisions B1 and B2 in docs/academic-framework.md.
 *     Nothing has been conferred under it and it can still change.
 *
 * Publishing the second as though it were the first would be the exact
 * category error this project exists to prevent, so every page that
 * touches it labels which is which.
 *
 * The same applies to academic misconduct: the College's POSITION on
 * integrity is adopted and argued (assessment design, not detection
 * software), while the PROCEDURE for handling a suspected breach is
 * governance item C9 and is marked awaiting. A student is told both.
